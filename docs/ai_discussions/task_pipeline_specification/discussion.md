Project Documentation: Task-Based Conversation Application with LLM, Voice Interaction, and Autonomous Task Planning

## Overview

This project aims to create an advanced task-based conversation application supporting multi-turn, vocal and text-based interactions with a large language model (LLM). The system will enable the LLM to introspectively analyze tasks, autonomously access external systems (such as filesystems, databases, and Git repositories), and actively gather necessary information before planning and executing complex tasks. A trust and approval mechanism will allow for varying levels of human oversight during the task execution process, enhancing the system's learning capabilities and adapting to user preferences. A memory or knowledge graph will facilitate the system's ability to learn from past interactions, mistakes, and user feedback, enabling it to evolve and improve over time. Additionally, an **Expectation Manager** will provide the LLM with a structured way to set its expectations during interactions, allowing it to be more proactive and nuanced in conversations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Task Management System**
   - Implement a task manager to handle various types of tasks, including introspective analysis, context gathering, task planning, and task execution.
   - All tasks should follow a structured pipeline, with dynamic prioritization and dependencies.
   - Support for synchronous (stack-based) and asynchronous (concurrent) task queues to allow flexible task handling.

2. **LLM with Introspection and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
   - Integrate an LLM with chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, enabling introspective analysis of task requirements.
   - **Introspection Stage**: The LLM should be able to "think" through tasks, analyzing the requirements, identifying gaps in information, and planning what additional context or dependencies it needs to gather.
   - **Context-Gathering Stage**: After introspection, the LLM should autonomously gather the necessary information from external systems.
     - Example: Read files, analyze code dependencies, query a database, or retrieve relevant project documentation.
   - **Action Planning Stage**: Once enough information is gathered, the LLM should then proceed to generate a detailed task plan with specific, actionable steps.

3. **Autonomous Task Execution with Feedback Loop**
   - After the LLM has gathered context and planned the task, it should execute the task and analyze the results.
   - If the execution reveals new information or additional dependencies, the LLM should use a **Feedback and Reiteration Stage** to re-enter the introspection phase.
   - The system should allow for iterative refinement and context augmentation to handle complex, multi-layered tasks that may need adjustment mid-execution.

4. **Conversation Interface with Voice and Text Support**
   - Implement a conversation interface with Next.js 15 and React 19, supporting both vocal and text-based interaction.
     - **Voice Input**: Use the Web Speech API for speech-to-text, allowing spoken input from the user.
     - **Voice Output**: Use TTS (Text-to-Speech) for vocal responses, allowing the system to "speak" to the user.
   - Maintain interaction history across sessions, providing continuity and context retention for long-term task progress.

5. **External System Access for Context Gathering**
   - Integrate system access that the LLM can use to autonomously retrieve required information, including:
     - **File Access**: Read files for relevant data or code.
     - **Git Repository Access**: Inspect codebases, track dependencies, or identify recent changes.
     - **Database Access**: Query necessary information from databases, e.g., project details, user information, or code snippets.
   - These resources should be accessible through API calls or local resource handlers, allowing the LLM to obtain context and dependencies for accurate task execution.

6. **Trust and Approval Mechanism**
   - Implement a trust and approval mechanism that defines varying levels of autonomy for the LLM based on user trust.
   - **Trust Levels**:
     - **Fully Trusted**: The system operates autonomously, executing tasks from discussion requirements to final delivery without human intervention.
     - **Partially Trusted**: The system requires human approval at critical stages (e.g., after planning or before execution) to enhance accuracy.
     - **Low Trust**: The system operates with significant human oversight, requiring explicit approval at each stage (introspection, context gathering, planning, and execution).
   - As the system learns user preferences and improves its accuracy, it can transition from lower to higher trust levels, gradually increasing autonomy.

7. **Memory or Knowledge Graph**
   - Integrate a memory or knowledge graph to store past interactions, decisions, and user feedback, allowing the system to learn and adapt over time.
   - The knowledge graph should facilitate:
     - **Contextual Learning**: The system can reference previous tasks and their outcomes, allowing it to improve task execution based on historical data.
     - **Error Correction**: The ability to recognize and learn from past mistakes, refining processes and approaches in future tasks.
     - **Augmented Context Generation**: By leveraging stored knowledge, the LLM can generate more relevant and informed responses based on accumulated context and user preferences.

8. **Expectation Manager**
   - Implement an expectation manager to allow the LLM to set and manage its own expectations during conversations and task execution.
   - The expectation manager should:
     - **Expectation Setting**: Enable the LLM to define what information or responses it needs from the user to progress in the workflow.
     - **Synchronous Clarification Tasks**: Create tasks that prompt the user for required information when automatic context gathering is insufficient, effectively communicating the LLM's needs.
     - **Expectation Tracking**: Monitor the progress of expected responses and actions, ensuring that the LLM can maintain focus on obtaining necessary information to advance tasks.
     - **Timeout Management**: Introduce reasonable timeouts to mimic human conversation dynamics, allowing the LLM to reiterate or follow up if the expected response is not received within a set timeframe.
     - **Proactive Engagement**: Equip the LLM to actively engage users by following up on outstanding questions or unmet expectations, ensuring that it remains effective and responsive throughout the interaction.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**
   - Design a modular system to support additional task types and external resources as needed.
   - Ensure flexibility for new, complex workflows that may require multiple introspection and execution cycles.

2. **Modularity and Extensibility**
   - Keep the architecture modular to allow isolated development, testing, and replacement of specific components, such as the LLM integration layer and task manager.

3. **Maintainability and Efficiency**
   - Ensure task execution is efficient, minimizing latency in task feedback to the user.
   - Design the system for single-developer manageability, with clear structure and separation of task types.

I'll help you explore and design the Task Manager system for Phase 3.1. Let me analyze the requirements and ask some clarifying questions to ensure we create the most effective design.



Let's start by breaking down the key requirements and exploring some architectural questions:

1. **Pipeline Structure Clarification**:
   - From the documentation, tasks go through introspection → context gathering → planning → execution stages.
   - Should tasks be allowed to skip certain stages based on complexity or type?
   - How should we handle cases where a task needs to return to a previous stage?

2. **Task Queue Types**:
   - The requirements mention both synchronous (stack-based) and asynchronous (concurrent) queues.
   - Could you clarify what types of tasks should be handled synchronously vs asynchronously?
   - How should we handle dependencies between tasks in different queues?

3. **State Management**:
   - How should we persist task state across the pipeline stages?
   - Should we maintain separate state stores for different types of tasks?

Let me create a high-level diagram of the proposed task management system to facilitate our discussion.

```mermaid

    C -->|Simple Task| D[Synchronous Queue]

    J -->|No| H

    end
    
    F --> O
    G --> O
    H --> O
    I --> O
    
    O --> P

```

Key questions for discussion:

1. **Task Classification**:
   - What criteria should we use to classify tasks as simple (synchronous) vs complex (asynchronous)?
   - Should we allow dynamic reclassification based on discovered complexity?

2. **Pipeline Flexibility**:
   - How strict should the pipeline stages be?
   - Should we allow custom pipelines for specific task types?

3. **State Persistence**:
   - What specific state information needs to be maintained across stages?
   - How should we handle task resumption after system interruptions?

4. **Error Handling**:
   - How should we handle failures at different pipeline stages?
   - What retry mechanisms should be implemented?

Let's discuss these points to refine the architecture before moving to detailed specifications. What are your thoughts on these aspects, and are there additional considerations we should address?
