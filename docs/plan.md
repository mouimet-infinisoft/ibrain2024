### Phase 1: Foundation and Core Integration
1. **Database & Supabase Setup**  
   - Define the schema for task, user, memory, and trust levels.
   - Implement tables and relationships for handling task management and user profiles.
   - Set up Supabase functions for data manipulation (e.g., task logging, interaction tracking).

2. **LLM & API Integration**  
   - Choose a suitable LLM API that supports chain-of-thought reasoning.
   - Implement core functionality for basic task introspection and simple response generation.
   - Build prompt templates for introspective task analysis and response generation.

3. **Authentication and Authorization Basics**  
   - Establish a simple authentication layer (even without complex sign-ups or password resets).
   - Configure basic role-based permissions (admin, trusted, guest) in Supabase for initial testing.

### Phase 2: Conversation Interface Development
1. **Implement Basic Voice and Text Interface**  
   - Set up a conversational interface using Next.js and React.
   - Integrate the Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.
   - Design the UI/UX to allow seamless switching between text and voice inputs.

2. **Implement Conversation History Tracking**  
   - Create a mechanism to log interaction history to Supabase, linking it to user profiles.
   - Ensure the system can retrieve and display past interactions, enabling context continuity.

3. **Expectation Manager Initial Setup**  
   - Develop a basic Expectation Manager module that can prompt users when information is missing.
   - Implement a timeout mechanism to prompt follow-ups, enhancing conversation flow.

### Phase 3: Task Management and Execution Pipelines
1. **Build Task Manager with Pipeline Structure**  
   - Implement a pipeline that categorizes tasks by introspection, context gathering, planning, and execution.
   - Design synchronous and asynchronous queues within the task manager for flexible handling of task dependencies.

2. **Establish Feedback and Reiteration Loop**  
   - Develop a feedback mechanism where task outcomes feed back into introspection.
   - Enable iterative refinement, allowing the LLM to revisit and adapt tasks based on feedback.

3. **Introduce Trust and Approval Mechanism**  
   - Define trust levels (fully trusted, partially trusted, low trust) and implement approval workflows for tasks.
   - Allow user adjustments to trust levels, dynamically adapting the system's autonomy.

### Phase 4: Context Gathering and Autonomous Execution
1. **Develop System Access Modules (Filesystem, Git, Database)**  
   - Implement secure APIs or functions for accessing external systems, such as reading files, querying Git repositories, and interacting with databases.
   - Set up access controls to ensure sensitive data remains secure.

2. **Integrate Context Gathering and Dependency Analysis**  
   - Build context-gathering logic that allows the LLM to autonomously retrieve information.
   - Use task dependency mapping to help the LLM recognize and fulfill its data needs.

3. **Enhance Task Execution with Autonomous Feedback Loops**  
   - Enable the LLM to autonomously analyze results and determine when to re-enter introspection if dependencies are incomplete.
   - Implement the iterative refinement loop for complex or multi-layered tasks.

### Phase 5: Memory and Knowledge Graph Development
1. **Design and Implement Knowledge Graph**  
   - Develop a memory or knowledge graph structure in Supabase to store interaction data and decisions.
   - Build a retrieval interface allowing the system to leverage past interactions for better contextual responses.

2. **Integrate Learning and Error Correction Mechanisms**  
   - Implement modules for error correction and feedback-based adjustments in task execution.
   - Store user feedback and outcomes to guide the LLM’s adaptive learning over time.

3. **Implement Semantic Search in Knowledge Graph**  
   - Use Supabase’s functions or integrate a vector database to enable efficient semantic search in the knowledge graph.
   - Build search capabilities for the LLM to find contextually relevant information efficiently.

### Phase 6: Advanced User Interaction and Adaptive Learning
1. **Enhance Expectation Management with Adaptive Prompts**  
   - Refine the expectation manager to allow proactive engagement, clarifying ambiguous inputs.
   - Introduce user-specific preferences to improve LLM interaction over time.

2. **User Profile and Adaptive Learning Setup**  
   - Design a module that builds user profiles based on interaction patterns and feedback.
   - Enable the LLM to adjust its responses according to individual user preferences, providing a personalized experience.

3. **Progress Tracking and Visualization**  
   - Implement a visual progress tracker for tasks, enhancing user engagement and task clarity.
   - Create notifications for task completion or follow-up needs, based on user preferences.

### Phase 7: Testing, Security, and Optimization
1. **Comprehensive Testing**  
   - Perform unit and integration tests across modules, particularly for conversation flow, task management, and LLM response accuracy.
   - Test voice and text interactions, validating UI functionality and ensuring robust task handling.

2. **Data Security and Privacy**  
   - Implement data protection protocols (e.g., encryption for sensitive data) and ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).
   - Use role-based access control to limit access to critical resources.

3. **Optimization for Scalability and Performance**  
   - Introduce load balancing for handling high-traffic periods, particularly in conversation interfaces and task execution.
   - Optimize asynchronous operations to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.

### Phase 8: Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Deploy the System with Monitoring**  
   - Set up the production environment, implementing real-time monitoring and logging for performance analysis.
   - Ensure error tracking and alerting for system health and response times.

2. **Implement Usage Analytics**  
   - Collect analytics on user interactions, task performance, and feedback loops.
   - Use data insights to continuously refine the LLM’s performance and system interaction flow.

3. **Maintenance and Future Scalability**  
   - Plan for iterative improvements, allowing for modular updates as new features or workflows are introduced.
   - Document the system architecture, APIs, and modules for ongoing maintenance and scalability support.
